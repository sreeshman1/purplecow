To run the app:

Using Yarn:
1. `yarn`
2. `yarn dev`

This should open up a browser tab at `localhost:3000` in your default browser.

Using Docker:
1. Make sure you have docker running
2. `docker compose up`

Future Updates:
- Add Testing
- Add a limit to the clicking the button to limit api calls
- Implement a cache on the front end that keeps track of button clicks and only send api calls periodically
